# Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Voice-Alert-System-Using-CNN
This project implements a "real-time traffic sign detection and voice alert system" using "OpenCV", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)", and "pyttsx3" for speech output. The system is designed to assist drivers by detecting traffic signs from live video feed and providing immediate voice feedback.
